A daily price-guessing game inspired by Wordle, featuring real Trader Joe's products!

## About the Game

**Trader Joedle** is a daily puzzle where you try to guess the price of a featured Trader Joe's product in 6 attempts or fewer. Each guess provides a hint to guide you toward the correct price:

- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow circle + arrow**: You're warm (within 25%) but need to go higher â†‘ or lower â†“
