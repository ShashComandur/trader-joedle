"""
This script is designed to get all of the product information for Trader Joedle using the Trader Joe's GraphQL API.
There are four product categories for all Trader Joe's items, as described in `categories.json`.
Running this script will output all product information for each category, formatted as JSON files in corresponding folders.

It grabs 100 products at a time - I did not want to cause any trouble by trying to pull more than that at once, as I have no information as to whether it is rate-limited. This is why I play it safe with the repeated queries.
Because this script is really only intended to be run once, I manually merged the resulting JSON files, which can be found in `src/lib/game/merged.json`.
The `src/lib/game/games.json`, which is what determines the daily games, was created from the resulting merged file.

Note that the raw output (the contents of the `food`, `beverage`, `plants`, and `everything-else` folders) has been ignored by git, as these files do not need to exist in the repository,

If you need this script for any reason and have questions, please reach out!
